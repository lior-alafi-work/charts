The agent for Sysdig Secure DevOps Platform is spinning up on each node in your
cluster. After a few seconds, you should see your hosts appearing in the
Sysdig Agent Health & Status Dashboard

Links for your deployment:
  * Sysdig Monitor: https://{{ include "monitorUrl" . }}/#/dashboard-template/view.sysdig.agents?last=10
  * Sysdig Secure: https://{{ include "secureUrl" . }}/#/data-sources/agents

{{- if and (.Values.ssl.ca.cert) (eq .Values.global.sysdig.region "custom") }}

We have appended the Sysdig Public CA to the CA bundle that you have provided due to global.sysdig.region="custom" being set.
This is to handle edge cases for on-premise installations that might need a Custom CA to verify the Collector and still download 
the pre-compiled probe from https://download.sysdig.com.
